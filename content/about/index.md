About Kevin Powell -- an embedded systems software engineer.

    When you are young, you enjoy
    a sustained illusion that
    sooner or later something
    marvelous is going to happen,
    that you are going to
    transcend your parents'
    limitations... At the same
    time, you feel sure that in
    all the wilderness of
    possibility; in all the
    forests of opinion, there is
    a vital something that can be
    known -- known and grasped.
    That we will eventually know
    it, and convert the whole
    mystery into a coherent
    narrative. So that then one's
    true life -- the point of
    everything -- will emerge
    from the mist into a pure
    light, into total
    comprehension. But it isn't
    like that at all. But if it
    isn't, where did the idea
    come from, to torture and
    unsettle us?
    -- Brian Aldiss, "Helliconia
    Summer"
