      <description>&lt;p&gt;I upgraded my audio setup at my desk by adding a new amplifier (ZK AS21) and nice speakers.&#xA;Tried out the amp with my phone as a source and everything sounded great.  Unfortunately, when&#xA;using my USB-C dock with onboard KTMicro (KT_USB_AUDIO) audio things sounded terrible: buzzing,&#xA;weird hooting noises, etc.  At first I thought it was a ground-loop problem but adding ground isolation&#xA;didn&amp;rsquo;t fix things.  What did help was adding a circuit in-line between the dock and the amp to reduce the&#xA;impedance seen by the dock.  As far as I can tell, the dock&amp;rsquo;s 3.5mm TRRS output is optimized for headphones&#xA;and things go poorly with a high impedance amp connected there.  Also, the amp wants stereo 3.5mm in (TRS)&#xA;while the dock has TRRS (with mic) out &amp;ndash; so I got a splitter from Amazon to do the TRRS -&amp;gt; TRS conversion.&#xA;[Headphone to Line-In]https://www.vwlowen.co.uk/radio/headphone2linein/headphones.htm&lt;/p&gt;</description>
