      <description>&lt;p&gt;I upgraded my audio setup at my desk by adding a new amplifier (ZK AS21) and nice speakers.&#xA;Tried out the amp with my phone as a source and everything sounded great.  Unfortunately, when&#xA;using my USB-C dock with onboard KTMicro (KT_USB_AUDIO) audio things sounded terrible: buzzing,&#xA;weird hooting noises, etc.  At first I thought it was a ground-loop problem but adding ground isolation&#xA;didn&amp;rsquo;t fix things.  What did help was adding a circuit in-line between the dock and the amp to reduce the&#xA;impedance seen by the dock.  As far as I can tell, the dock&amp;rsquo;s 3.5mm TRRS output is optimized for (low impedance)&#xA;headphones and things go poorly with a high impedance amp connected there.&#xA;Also, the amp wants stereo 3.5mm in (TRS) while the dock has TRRS (with mic)&#xA;out &amp;ndash; so I got a splitter from Amazon to do the TRRS -&amp;gt; TRS conversion.&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vwlowen.co.uk/radio/headphone2linein/headphones.htm&#34; title=&#34;Headphone to Line-In&#34;&gt;Headphone to Line-In&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;There is a lot of conflicting info about the assignments of the conductors in the trrs cable.&#xA;I found that my dock uses tip for left audio, ring1 for right audio, ring2 for ground, and the sleeve for mic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
